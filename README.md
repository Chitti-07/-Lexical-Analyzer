# -Lexical-Analyzer
A Lexical Analyzer, often called a Lexer, is a component of a compiler or interpreter that processes source code as the first step of compilation or interpretation. It takes raw source code as input and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are meaningful components like keywords, identifiers, literals, operators.
