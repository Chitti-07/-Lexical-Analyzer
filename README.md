# -Lexical-Analyzer
A Lexical Analyzer, often called a Lexer, is a component of a compiler or interpreter that processes source code as the first step of compilation or interpretation. It takes raw source code as input and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are meaningful components like keywords, identifiers, literals, operators.
➤ Developed a lexical analyzer in C to tokenize sequences into Keywords, Identifiers, Operators, etc., for compiler design.
➤ Inspired by tools like Lex and Yacc to enhance the efficiency of source code tokenization.
➤ Ensured seamless integration with parsers by providing robust token recognition for accurate syntax validation.
